We the undersigned promise that we have in good faith attempted
to follow the principles of pair programming. Although we were free to discuss
ideas with others, the implementation is our own. We have shared a common workspace and
taken turns at the keyboard for the majority of the work that we are submitting.
Furthermore, any non programming portions of the assignment were done independently.
We recognize that should this not be the case,
we will be subject to penalties as outlined in the course syllabus.
